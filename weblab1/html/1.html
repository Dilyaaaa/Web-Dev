    <h1> I know why the caged bird sings </h1>
    <h2>by Maya Angelou</h2>
    <p>A free bird leaps on the back<br>
    Of the wind and floats downstream<br>
    Till the current ends and dips his wing<br>
     In the orange suns rays<br>
     And dares to claim the sky.
    </p>
    <p>But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage<br>
    Can seldom see through his bars of rage<br>
His wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
So he opens his throat to sing.
